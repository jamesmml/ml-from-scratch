# Machine Learning Foundations: Linear and Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Description
This repository contains implementations of linear and logistic regression algorithms coded from scratch in Python. These projects were designed while following along Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning Specialization course on Coursera. The code includes functions for training models using gradient descent, calculating cost functions, and visualizing data/results.

## Contents
LinearandLogisiticRegressionFromScratch.ipynb

LinearandLogisiticRegressionFromScratchUtils.py - utils only

## How to Run
The .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebooks) can be run from top to bottom where they exhibit my machine learning journey. 

The .py files contain the reusable functions for linear/logistic regression models. One can import these functions for use in other projects or one can use them as standalone scripts.

## What One Will Learn
This project helped me understand the fundamentals of machine learning, including gradient descent, cost functions, and model training (supervised learning).
